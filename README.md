Scala traning for me and for you
================================
This repository services as a  cheat sheet of scala and contains my learning experience from the following resources:
* [Scala By Example](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf) by Martin Odersky
* [A Scala Tutorial
for Java programmers](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf) by Michel Schinz, Philipp
Haller

Copy&Paste from the above resourcess is unavoidable simpy because I want to remember those hardcores!

Howerver, if there's any issue, don't hesitate to shoot me an email: jiefeng.hopkins@gmail.com 


Compiling

Cheat Sheet
----------
`() => Unit` is the type of all functions which take no arguments and return nothing


**Class comparison and conversion**
* *Comparison*: `object.isInstanceOf[class]`
* *Conversion*: `= object.asInstanceOf[class]`
