Constructor of class
====================
* **Primary constructor** is defined by putting parameters of in parentheses directly after the name of the class. Example:
```scala
class Animal(species: String){
}
```
* Any code sitting inside the curly braces surrounding, but outside of method or variable definition, is compiled into the body of a constructor generated by the Scala compiler, which takes the class parameters as constructor parameters. Example:
```scala
class Animal(species: String){
  if (species == null)
    throw new NullPointerException("species is null")
}
```
* Multiple constructors in scala can be defined with overloaded parameter lists. A *primary constructor* should be selected first and defined as above, then additional **auxiliary constructors** are defined in the body of the class like methods named **this** that have no result type. The first statement in an *auxiliary constructor* must be an invocation of another constructor in the same class. Example:
```scala
class Animal(species: String, age: Int) {
  if (species == null)
    throw new NullPointerException("species is null")
  def this(species: String) = this(species, -1)
  def greet() = {
    species match{
      case "Cat" => 
        println("meow")
      case "Dog" => 
        println("woof")
      case _ =>
        println("damn!")
    }
    if (age < 0) println("I don't know my age")
    else println("My age is " + age)
  }
}
```
